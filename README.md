Save the fish! This mod changes the item you get from mining fish to a placeable fish item that allows you to rehome fish from your nasty green polluted ponds.

Compatibility with:
- [asher_sky's More Fish](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/more-fish)

I felt like version control was in order. Source for the catch and release mod
